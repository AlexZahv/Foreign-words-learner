This program serves to simplify a process of learning new foreign words.
It provides capabilities to:
1. Add new words to vocabulary.
2. Repeat already stored in database words.
3. Train your skills. In this mode you must write the right translation to the proposed word. If
your answer will be right, the indicator in the bottom of program window will inform you about it, another way the right answer will be
displayed in translation field. Each right answer increments the counter of answers and each wrong answer decrements it. When counter becomes
more or equals 5, then this word will be marked as "learned".  First four words< which are offered you in this mode are marked as not learned yet, every fifth word
is marked as learned. This is made for compromise between learning new words and repeating already known words.
4. Check the answer mode is used to verify if your answer is right or not;
5. Delete word from database and also delete all it relations.
